Simple Hearthstone tracker. Just track your win and loss. On app you'll find:
- your current rank and star
- how many win needed 'til next rank milestone
- global winrate
- winrate with each deck
- persist data in local browser storage
- stats against opponent's deck types
- charts on rank progress, deck winrates
- set notes on deck types
- arena page

Maybe one day this app will:
- get a real design ;)
- MOAR CHARTS!!! CHARTS EVERYWHERE!!!
- get a lot of pink unicorned stuff
