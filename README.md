## Mobile app
Trackerstone is a Progressive Web Application, meaning that it's designed to work both on web browser and mobile app.

With your mobile device, go on <a target="_blank" href="https://keiwen.github.io/Trackerstone/">Trackerstone page</a>, then:
- You have a smart browser, it will ask you by itself if you want to add Trackerstone.

- Or basic way: open the menu and select "add to home screen".

Now you can just click on the Trackerstone icon on your device to open a fullscreen application!

Mobile app orientation is landscape defined, as you should use Hearthstone game landscape as well.

Note: according to your phone configuration, switching on app may reload Hearthstone game.

Deck type and deck now have a card illustration on their background.
These illustrations are coming form <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HearthSim/hsdata">HS Data project</a>.
