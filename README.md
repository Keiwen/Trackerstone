> Experiments with VueJS framework

Simple Hearthstone tracker. Just track your win and loss. On app you'll find:
- your current rank and star
- how many win needed 'til next rank milestone
- global winrate
- winrate with each deck
- persist data in local browser storage

Maybe one day this app will let you know:
- stats against opponent's deck types
- graph with progress history
- and of course a lot of pink unicorned stuff
